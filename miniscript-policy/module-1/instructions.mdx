<IntroductionCard title="Introduction" subtitle="Welcome to the Miniscript Policy Puzzle Challenge!">
    Miniscript is a powerful language that makes Bitcoin scripts more accessible, safer, and easier to analyze. It allows developers to express complex Bitcoin spending conditions in a structured way, while automatically handling low-level Script details.

    Programming anything but simple scripts is fraught with challenges. To address these challenges and enable advanced spending coditions, Miniscript was created to provide a policy language that is a simple expressive language that humans can use to codify spending conditions.

    In this challenge, you'll be tasked with creating a Bitcoin transaction's spending conditions in Miniscript syntax. The goal is to express the provided spending paths in Miniscript, which when compiled, results in a Bitcoin script that accurately represents these conditions.
