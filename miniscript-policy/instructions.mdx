  <ChallengeBrief title="Miniscript Policy Puzzle">
    Given a description of a Bitcoin transaction's spending conditions, participants are required to construct a corresponding Miniscript representation. Miniscript is a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, enhanced with batteries that facilitate script composition, ease, verify correctness. The goal of this challenge is to express the provided spending paths in Miniscript, which, when compiled, results in a Bitcoin script that accurately represents these conditions. This script must satisfy the provided spending conditions
