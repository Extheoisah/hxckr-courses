  <ChallengeBrief title="Miniscript Policy Puzzle">
    Given a description of a Bitcoin transaction's spending conditions, participants are required to construct a corresponding Miniscript representation. Miniscript is a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, enhanced with batteries that facilitate script composition, ease, verify correctness. The goal of this challenge is to express the provided spending paths in Miniscript, which, when compiled, results in a Bitcoin script that accurately represents these conditions. This script must satisfy the provided spending conditions
  </ChallengeBrief>

  <LearningObjectives title="Learning Objectives">
    Understand how to translate Bitcoin spending conditions into Miniscript syntax

    Master the composition of complex spending conditions using Miniscript's structured format

    Learn to validate and verify the correctness of Miniscript expressions

    Gain proficiency in compiling Miniscript into valid Bitcoin Script

    Develop skills in optimizing spending conditions for efficiency and cost

    <Stage title="Create a Single Signature Policy" difficulty="Medium" isExpandable={true} initialLines={0}>
      Create a single signature policy requiring one signature from the public key to spend the transaction. This test policy checks to see that a single key can spend when encumbered by the spending condition requiring just the key.
    </Stage>
    <Stage title="Create a One of Two Signatures Policy" difficulty="Medium" isExpandable={true} initialLines={0}>
      Create a one of two signatures policy requiring one signature from either of two public keys to spend the transaction. This test policy checks to see that either key can independently spend when encumbered by the spending condition requiring either key.
    </Stage>
    <Stage title="Create a Weighted One of Two Signatures Policy" difficulty="Medium" isExpandable={true} initialLines={0}>
      Create a weighted one of two signatures policy requiring one signature from either of two public keys to spend the transaction. This test policy checks to see that either key can independently spend when encumbered by the spending condition requiring either key.
