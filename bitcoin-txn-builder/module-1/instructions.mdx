<IntroductionCard title="Introduction" subtitle="Welcome to the Fix the Bitcoin Transaction Builder Challenge!">
  Bitcoin transactions are the fundamental building blocks of the network. A properly implemented transaction builder must handle 
  UTXO selection, fee calculation, script creation, and transaction signing. In this challenge, you'll fix a simple broken transaction 
  builder implementation while learning about these critical concepts.

  You'll gain hands-on experience with transaction construction, UTXO management, and Bitcoin scripting.
